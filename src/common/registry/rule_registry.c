/* Shim removed: the flat registry compatibility shim has been removed.
 *
 * The codebase now uses the category-indexed generated registry from
 * include/common/generated_rules.h. To reconstruct a flat view, iterate the
 * categories and their entries returned by leuko_get_rule_categories().
 *
 * This file intentionally contains no compiled symbols; remove it from the
 * repository when ready.
